    "3. Look through the code. Do I follow the logic of what's being done? I ask questions if I don't.\n",
    "4. Check the tests. Have tests been added for any new features? Do they cover the scope of the new feature? Do they help me understand the code in any way? \n",
    "5. Consider the user. Is the API of the code changing from what already exists? Will it impact users significantly? \n",
    "6. Look through the code. Suggest constructive improvements. Do I see a lot of functionality that's repeated that can be put into a single function? Do I see a place where a design pattern could be used? I try to add suggestions for improvement as code snippets. \n",
    "7. Try to use the feature. I don't always do this, but for new features I do. Do I run into any errors when I use it? Does it make sense in my workflow?\n",

    "* Having good developer documentation (what linter and formatter do your code use? What is your docs style) helps make the contributor experience a bit less iterative.\n",
    "* Having your issue tracker with clearly described issues helps people other than you understand what's going on in the project. \n",
    "* Labeling issues with things like `good first issue` and what type of fix the issue is (e.g. `documentation`, `testing`, or something feature-specific means that potential contributors can more easily choose a contribution they are comfortable with. This also ensures that the contribution somebody addresses from the issue tracker is relevant to the project. \n",
